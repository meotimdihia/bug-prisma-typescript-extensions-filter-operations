# Prisma Client Extension - Model Filters

This example demonstrates a Prisma Client extension which adds reusable filters for a model which can be composed and passed to a `where` condition. Complex, frequently used filtering conditions can be written once and accessed in many queries through the extended Prisma Client instance.

## Caveats

This extension is provided as an example only. It is not intended to be used in production environments.

Please read [the documentation on `model` extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/model) for more information.
